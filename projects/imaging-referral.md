This is a Google Sheets Addon bound to the clinic list template 'Auto Clinic List'.

It displays a sidebar application that provides a form to generate an Imaging Referral Form.

The addon is available in the clinic list from:

Podogo > Imaging Referral

### Instructions

1. Open the application
2. Select a patient
3. Fill in the form
4. Submit the form with the button at the base of the sidebar
5. The referral form will open in your browser when the function is complete

### Used Technologies and Libraries

- [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script)

### Notes

Because it is manually installed, you must authenticate the application with each use. It would be more efficient to convert this script to an installed addon to avoid this.
