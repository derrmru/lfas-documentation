The application is boot strapped with Create React App, built locally and served via Godaddy. The corresponding directory is medical.londonfootandanklesurgery.co.uk.

The application communicates with Google Workspace, where the forms are stored, via a library of [Google Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/web). These web apps expose essential functionality, including:
