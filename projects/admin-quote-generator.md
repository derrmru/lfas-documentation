This is a Google Sheets Addon bound to the clinic list template 'Auto Clinic List'.

The addon takes some input from the clinic list and user, via a sidebar html form, and generates a Surgery Quote as a document.

Execute the add on by going to:

Podogo > Generate Quote

The fees are derived from the [Surgery Quote Web App](/projects/surgery-fees).
