This is a Single Page Application that allows the user to reserve, and if needed, pay for an appointment online.

The application is boot strapped with Create React App, built locally and served via Godaddy. The corresponding directory is bookonline.podogo.com.

The application communicates with Google Workspace, where appointments are managed, via a library of [Google Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/web). These web apps expose essential functionality, including:

- appointment availability
- verification with a simple Boolean whether a patient exists (for follow up appointments)
- receive appointment requests

See section on Web Apps for more information.

Payments are facilitated via Paypal.

Address autocompletion available from Google Maps Places API and implemented via our bespoke component, Places Autocomplete React.
