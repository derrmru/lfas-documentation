### Notes

It is a long term goal to improve the speed of this website, which will soon affect google search rankings. Possible avenues discussed are:

- Using next gen image formats (webp)
- Lazyloading images
- We could develop a static / SSR hybrid site using a framework like Gatsby or Next JS, but this is labour intensive and should be done in-house

The site is hosted by Godaddy who provide:

- Hosting (shared with other websites)
- Email Service (via Cpanel, not hosted email)
- SSL (managed SSL)
